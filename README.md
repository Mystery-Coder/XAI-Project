# XAI-Project
This project leverages Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance transparency and interpretability in financial models. By providing clear, interpretable insights, this project aims to help financial analysts understand and trust AI-driven predictions, especially in sensitive areas like loan default prediction and stock forecasting.

# Overview
*Loan Default Classification*: Classify loan applications based on the likelihood of default with interpretable outputs.<br><br>
*Property Value Regression*: Predict property values and explain the factors influencing predictions.<br><br>
*Stock Price Regression*: Provide stock price predictions, breaking down the modelâ€™s logic behind price changes.<br><br>
**Quantified Insights**: Use XAI to explain model accuracy and reliability across each domain.<br><br>
